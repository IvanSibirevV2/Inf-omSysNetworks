PCAUSA Test TCP Utility V2.01.01.07
Usage: pcattcp -t [-options] host [ < in ]
       pcattcp -r [-options > out]
Common options:
   -l ##  length of bufs read from or written to network (default 8192)
   -u     use UDP instead of TCP
   -p ##  port number to send to or listen at (default 5001)
   -s     toggle sinkmode (enabled by default)
            sinkmode enabled:
               -t: source (transmit) fabricated pattern
               -r: sink (discard) all received data
            sinkmode disabled:
               -t: reads data to be transmitted from stdin
               -r: writes received data to stdout
   -A     align the start of buffers to this modulus (default 16384)
   -O     start buffers at this offset from the modulus (default 0)
   -v     verbose: print more statistics
   -d     set SO_DEBUG socket option
   -b ##  set socket buffer size (if supported)
   -f X   format for rate: k,K = kilo{bit,byte}; m,M = mega; g,G = giga
   -c       -t: send continuously
            -r: accept multiple connections sequentially
   -R     concurrent TCP/UDP multithreaded receiver
Options specific to -t:
   -n ##  number of source bufs written to network (default 2048)
   -D     don't buffer TCP writes (sets TCP_NODELAY socket option)
   -w ##  milliseconds of delay before each write (default 0)
Options specific to -r:
   -B     for -s, only output full blocks as specified by -l (for TAR)
   -T     "touch": access each byte as it's read
